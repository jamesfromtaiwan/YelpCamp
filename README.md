## Author's note
This is the barely minimum viable version of my app. There are fews things to be added:

1. Error handling using Promise
2. Script files to be added for interactivity
  * jQuery for ajax performance.
  * Others in ES6.
3. More form validation to avoid injection and add security layer
4. Add node cluster and proper logging npm for production version app
5. Add profile section.
6. Add gulp to minify the static files
